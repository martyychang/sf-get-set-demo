This project demonstrates the nuanced differences between using `{ get; set; }`
vs. traditional getter and setter methods. Below are recommended steps
for exploring the differences between the two approaches of defining
_properties_ in Apex.

1. Run all Apex tests.
2. Read the test code and comments in `LonghandExampleTest` and
   `ShorthandExampleTest` to reflect on the differences.
3. Open the **GetterSetterDemo** Visualforce page.
4. Read the test code and comments in `GetterSetterDemoControllerTest`.
